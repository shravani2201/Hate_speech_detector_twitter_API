# Hate_speech_detector_twitter_API
This project focuses on the development of an advanced Hate Speech/Offensive speech Detection system with an integrated Twitter posting feature. 
It encompasses a user-friendly web dashboard that allows users to submit text for analysis. Upon analysis, the system provides clear results, classifying the text as either hate speech or non-hate speech, while also quantifying the intensity of any detected offensive content. Furthermore, users are offered the option to post the analyzed text directly to their Twitter accounts through a secure and user-friendly interface.
